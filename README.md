# Note-Taker

A .NET Core WPF Note Taking app written using C#. 

This app is built keeping the MVVM design architecture in mind. The application uses Dapper and SQLite database to store and manage notes.

The purpose of this application was for me to learn C# and learn MVVM design architecture.

## Current Features 

- Save Notes.
- Delete Notes
- Search Notes
- Modify Notes
- Great looking UI

## Requirements

- You will need to have .Net Core version 3 installed on your windows system.  

- You will also need Visual Studio Code 19, to open and run the project. 

## Installation

- git clone the project repository
- Open the project in Visual Studio Code 19.
- Run it

## Features to Implement

- In future I will be looking to add a Login/signup feature to the app to make it more secure and prevent anyone else from accessing the notes.
- I am also working on feature to add audio logs as notes. In future this may even extend to video logs.
